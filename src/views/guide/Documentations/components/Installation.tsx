                    After extracting the downloaded .zip file, you'll find two
                    folders <strong>TypeScript</strong> and{' '}
                    <strong>JavaScript</strong>. Each folder contains the
                    following sub-directories:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>demo</strong>
                        <p className="mt-1">
                            This folder contains the full demo of the project,
                            including everything you see in the live preview.
                            It's meant for reference only and{' '}

                            The starter pack provides the basic setup for the
                            template. This is where you should begin your
                            development, creating pages and adding your code. We
                            recommend copying this folder into your workspace.

                            This folder includes an index.html file that
                            redirects to the online documentation.

                <p>
                    Once you've chosen your desired package, navigate to the
                    project's root directory (where <code>package.json</code> is
                    located) and run the following command in your console:
                </p>
                <SyntaxHighlighter>npm install</SyntaxHighlighter>
                <p>
                    This will install all necessary dependencies in the
                    node_modules directory, allowing you to start development.
